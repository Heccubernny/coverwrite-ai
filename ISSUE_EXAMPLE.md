**Describe the issue or request in detail:**
##### Example:
I've noticed that the CoverwriteAI fails to save my generated cover letters. After I've generated a cover letter, I click the "Save" button, but nothing happens, and the cover letter isn't saved. This issue occurs consistently on my Windows 10 computer using Google Chrome.


#### Feature Request:
###### A clear and concise description of the issue or feature request

I'd like to request a new feature for the CoverWriteAI. It would be very helpful if we could have the option to download the generated cover letters. This would allow users to have access to their previous generated cover letter and modify it to their better taste.

### Expected Behavior
**What should happen?**
###### A description of what you expected the CoverWriteAI to do or how the new feature should work.
I expected that when I clicked the "Save" button, the cover letter would be saved to my local storage or prompt me to download it as a PDF file. This way, I could easily access and share the generated cover letter in the future.


### Actual Behavior

It redirect me back to the previous page and showing the error in the picture below.
